            "passage": "Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms' activities. This process involves the absorption of light by pigments such as chlorophyll, which is found in the chloroplasts of plant cells. The absorbed light energy is then used to power a series of chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The overall equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2 This equation can be broken down into two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, light energy is absorbed by pigments in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts, and this energy is used to generate ATP and NADPH, which are energy-rich molecules that will be used in the next stage. Water is also split in this stage, releasing oxygen gas as a byproduct. In the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is fixed into organic molecules using the energy from ATP and NADPH generated in the light-dependent reactions. This process involves a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that convert carbon dioxide into glucose, which can be used by the plant for energy or stored as starch. Photosynthesis is essential for life on Earth, as it provides the primary source of energy for most ecosystems. It is also an important source of oxygen, which is necessary for the survival of most living organisms.",

It is a measure of the variety of life on Earth and the natural systems that support it. Biodiversity is essential to the functioning of ecosystems and the provision of ecosystem services, which are the benefits that people obtain from ecosystems. These services include food, water, and clean air, as well as cultural and recreational opportunities. Biodiversity also has important economic, social, and environmental values, and it is a key component of sustainable development. Biodiversity is threatened by a range of factors, including habitat loss, overexploitation of natural resources, pollution, invasive species, and climate change. These threats are causing a decline in the number of species and a reduction in the variety of ecosystems and genetic diversity. The loss of biodiversity can have negative impacts on ecosystems and the services they provide, as well as on human well-being. Conservation efforts are underway to protect biodiversity and prevent further loss. These efforts include the establishment of protected areas, the restoration of degraded ecosystems, and the sustainable use of natural resources. International agreements, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, have been established to promote the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Biodiversity is a complex and dynamic concept that is essential to the functioning of ecosystems and the well-being of human societies. It is important to recognize the value of biodiversity and to take action to protect it for future generations.",

The theory of evolution is based on the idea that species change over time, with new species arising from existing ones through a process of natural selection. The theory of evolution was first proposed by Charles Darwin in his book \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859. Darwin's theory was based on his observations of the natural world, including the diversity of life on Earth and the similarities between different species. He proposed that species evolve over time through a process of natural selection, where individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to their offspring. Since Darwin's time, the theory of evolution has been extensively studied and supported by a vast body of evidence from various fields of science, including genetics, paleontology, and comparative anatomy. The fossil record provides evidence of the gradual changes in the characteristics of species over time, while genetic studies have shown that all living organisms share a common ancestry. The theory of evolution has also been the subject of much debate and controversy, particularly among those who hold religious or philosophical beliefs that conflict with the idea of evolution. However, the overwhelming scientific consensus is that evolution is a fundamental principle of biology and a key to understanding the diversity of life on Earth.",

It is an important process in the Earth's climate system and plays a key role in regulating the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, which affects the Earth's temperature and climate. The carbon cycle is divided into three main reservoirs: the atmosphere, the oceans, and the land. The atmosphere is the largest reservoir of carbon, with about 750 billion metric tons of carbon. The oceans contain about 38,000 billion metric tons of carbon, mostly in the form of dissolved inorganic carbon. The land contains about 2,000 billion metric tons of carbon, mostly in the form of organic matter in soil and vegetation. Carbon moves between these reservoirs through a series of processes, including photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, and combustion. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other organisms convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into organic matter, such as glucose. This organic matter is then consumed by other organisms, either directly or indirectly, and the carbon is passed through the food chain. Respiration is the process by which organisms release carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. Decomposition is the process by which dead organic matter is broken down into simpler compounds, releasing carbon back into the atmosphere. Combustion is the process by which carbon-containing fuels, such as coal or gasoline, are burned, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The carbon cycle is influenced by a number of factors, including climate, land use, and human activities.",

The treaty covers all ecosystems, species, and genetic resources, and seeks to address the causes of biodiversity loss by promoting sustainable development and the use of science-based knowledge. The CBD has established a number of mechanisms to support the achievement of its goals, including the Clearing-House Mechanism, the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on Article 8(j), and the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice. The CBD has also established a number of programmes of work and budget, including the Programme of Work on Protected Areas, the Programme of Work on Marine and Coastal Biodiversity, and the Programme of Work on Article 8(j) and Traditional Knowledge.
