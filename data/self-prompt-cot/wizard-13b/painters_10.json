            "passage": "Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) was an Italian polymath, regarded as one of the greatest painters of all time and as a leading light of the Italian Renaissance. He was born in the Tuscan town of Vinci, in the heart of the Florentine Republic. The son of a wealthy notary, Piero da Vinci, and a peasant woman, Caterina, Leonardo was educated in the studio of the renowned Florentine painter Andrea del Verrocchio. Leonardo's early life was marked by a restless curiosity and a desire to learn. He was fascinated by the natural world and spent much of his time studying the laws of science and the workings of the human body. He was also a gifted musician and played the lyre and the lira da braccio. In 1482, Leonardo moved to Milan, where he was employed as a military engineer and architect by the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza. It was during this period that he painted some of his most famous works, including the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper. Leonardo was a prolific inventor and engineer, designing machines and devices that were centuries ahead of their time. He made detailed sketches of flying machines, helicopters, and parachutes, and was one of the first people to recognize the importance of aerodynamics. He also designed war machines, including tanks and cannons, and was a pioneer in the field of hydrodynamics. In addition to his artistic and scientific pursuits, Leonardo was also a skilled writer and philosopher. He wrote extensively on a wide range of topics, including anatomy, botany, and geology.",

In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. His suicide at just 37 years of age followed years of mental illness and poverty. Van Gogh was born in Groot-Zundert, Netherlands, the son of a pastor. He was raised in a religious and cultured environment and was given art lessons by his uncle, who was a minister and amateur artist. In 1869, he began his career as an art dealer in The Hague, but he soon abandoned this in favour of a life as a painter. After a period of training and study, he moved to Brussels in 1880, where he began to develop his unique style. He moved to Paris in 1886, where he was influenced by the Impressionist movement, and then to Arles in the south of France in 1888, where he created some of his most famous works. Van Gogh's early works were dark and somber, but he gradually developed a brighter and more colourful palette.",

Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent from an early age. As a teenager, he was already an accomplished artist, and he went on to study at the Royal Academy of San Fernando in Madrid before moving to Paris in 1904, where he quickly became a central figure in the city's artistic community. Throughout his long and prolific career, Picasso worked in a wide variety of styles, from the realism of his early work to the abstract expressionism of his later years. Picasso was also known for his many relationships and marriages, including his marriage to the Russian ballerina Olga Khokhlova, which lasted from 1918 to 1932.

He is generally considered one of the greatest painters and printmakers in European art history and the most important in Dutch history. His contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the Dutch Golden Age. Rembrandt's portraits of his contemporaries were characterized by the use of rich colors, dramatic contrasts of light and shadow, and a strong sense of psychological insight. His paintings often depicted scenes from the Bible, as well as historical and mythological subjects. He was also skilled in the use of etching, and produced many prints, including landscapes, genre scenes, and portraiture. Rembrandt's style evolved over the course of his career, and he was influenced by a wide range of artists and artistic movements. In his early works, he was heavily influenced by the Italian Baroque, but in his later years, he developed a more personal and experimental style, often using unconventional techniques and subject matter. Rembrandt's work was highly regarded by his contemporaries, and he was considered one of the most important painters of his time. However, his reputation declined in the 19th century, and he was largely forgotten until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when his work was rediscovered and reevaluated.

However, he became interested in the Impressionist style, which emphasized the use of light and color to capture the fleeting effects of sunlight and atmosphere. Monet's paintings often featured bright, vivid colors and loose brushstrokes, which gave them a sense of movement and spontaneity. One of Monet's most famous works is his series of paintings of the Rouen Cathedral, which he painted from different angles and at different times of day. Monet was fascinated by the way that light and shadow affected the appearance of the cathedral, and he painted it over 30 times in a variety of styles. In addition to his landscape paintings, Monet was also known for his series of paintings of water lilies, which he created in the last years of his life. These paintings were inspired by the pond in his garden in Giverny, and they feature the delicate, floating flowers against a background of blue water and sky.

            "passage": "Edvard Munch (1863-1944) was a Norwegian painter and printmaker whose intensely evocative treatment of psychological themes built upon some of the main tenets of late 19th-century Symbolism and greatly influenced the development of Expressionism in the 20th century. Munch was born in Løten, Norway, and his family moved to Christiania (now Oslo) when he was five. He studied at the Royal School of Art and Design in Christiania from 1881 to 1885, and in 1889 he traveled to Paris, where he was exposed to the work of the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. Munch's early work was influenced by the naturalistic painting style of the time, but he soon developed a more personal and symbolic approach to art. His most famous work, The Scream (1893), is a powerful expression of existential angst and despair, and it has become an icon of modern art. Munch's other major works include The Kiss (1892), a hauntingly beautiful image of two lovers embracing, and Madonna (1895-1902), a complex and enigmatic portrait of a woman that has been interpreted in many different ways. Throughout his career, Munch was fascinated by the themes of love, death, and the human condition, and his work often explored the darker aspects of human experience. He was also interested in the relationship between art and technology, and he experimented with a variety of printing techniques, including lithography and woodcut. Munch's influence on modern art cannot be overstated.",

Pollock's art was characterized by a physical, almost violent, approach to painting. He would lay his canvases on the ground and pour, drip, and splatter paint onto them, using a variety of tools such as sticks, brushes, and even his own body to apply the paint. Pollock's art was deeply influenced by his personal life, including his struggles with alcoholism and mental illness. He was also influenced by the works of other artists, such as Pablo Picasso and the Mexican muralists. Pollock's art was often seen as a reflection of the chaos and uncertainty of the post-World War II era. Pollock's most famous works include \"Number 1, 1950\" (Lavender Mist), \"Convergence\" (1952), and \"One: Number 31, 1950\" (also known as \"Lavender Mist\"). These works are considered some of the most important examples of abstract expressionism and are highly sought after by collectors. Despite his success, Pollock's life was marked by tragedy. In 1946, he was involved in a car accident that left him with a broken leg and a damaged hip. He also struggled with alcoholism and mental illness, which contributed to his death in a car crash in 1956.

He also had a close relationship with his wife, Gala, whom he referred to as his \"surrealist muse.\" Despite his controversial reputation, Dali's work was widely admired and influential.
