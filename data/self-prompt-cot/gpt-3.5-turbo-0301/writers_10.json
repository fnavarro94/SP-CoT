            "passage": "William Shakespeare was an English playwright, poet, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and one of the world's greatest dramatists. He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. Until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights. Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that included all but two of his plays. The volume was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as \"not of an age, but for all time\". Shakespeare's plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.",

            "passage": "Jane Austen (16 December 1775 – 18 July 1817) was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which interpret, critique and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. Her use of biting irony, along with her realism, humour, and social commentary, have long earned her acclaim among critics, scholars, and popular audiences alike. Austen's novels, including Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814), Emma (1815), Northanger Abbey (1818), and Persuasion (1818), are considered literary classics, bridging the gap between romance and realism. They are also notable for their wit, social observation, and insights into the lives of women in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Austen was born in Steventon, Hampshire, England, to a family of modest means. Her father, George Austen, was a rector and her mother, Cassandra Leigh, was the daughter of a wealthy family. Austen was the seventh of eight children and was educated primarily at home by her father and older brothers. She began writing as a teenager and completed her first novel, Lady Susan, at the age of 19. However, it was not published until after her death. Austen's novels were published anonymously during her lifetime and were initially well-received by critics and readers alike. However, her popularity waned after her death, and it was not until the mid-19th century that her works began to be rediscovered and appreciated for their literary merit. Today, Austen is widely regarded as one of the greatest novelists in the English language and her works continue to be adapted for film, television, and stage. Austen never married and lived with her family for most of her life. She died at the age of 41, likely from Addison's disease, and was buried in Winchester Cathedral. Despite her relatively short life and limited output, Austen's legacy endures, and her works continue to be read and studied by scholars and readers around the world.",

            "passage": "Ernest Hemingway (July 21, 1899 – July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short-story writer, journalist, and sportsman. His economical and understated style—which he termed the iceberg theory—had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his adventurous lifestyle and his public image brought him admiration from later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short-story collections, and two non-fiction works. Three of his novels, four short-story collections, and three non-fiction works were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of American literature. Hemingway was raised in Oak Park, Illinois. After high school, he reported for a few months for The Kansas City Star before leaving for the Italian front to enlist as an ambulance driver in World War I. In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home. His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel A Farewell to Arms (1929). In 1921, Hemingway married Hadley Richardson, the first of his four wives. The couple moved to Paris, where he worked as a foreign correspondent and fell under the influence of the modernist writers and artists of the 1920s \"Lost Generation\" expatriate community. His debut novel, The Sun Also Rises, was published in 1926. After his 1927 divorce from Richardson, Hemingway married Pauline Pfeiffer; they divorced after he returned from the Spanish Civil War, where he had been a journalist, and after which he wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940). Martha Gellhorn became his third wife in 1940; they separated after he met Mary Welsh in London during World War II. He was present at the Normandy landings and the liberation of Paris. Hemingway maintained permanent residences in Key West, Florida (in the 1930s) and Cuba (in the 1940s and 1950s). In 1959, he bought a house in Ketchum, Idaho, where he committed suicide in the summer of 1961. In the decades following his death, Hemingway's reputation declined as his critical standing suffered in the wake of negative assessments of his later works by figures such as William Faulkner and Lionel Trilling.",

            "passage": "Joanne Rowling, better known by her pen name J.K. Rowling, is a British author, philanthropist, film producer, television producer, and screenwriter. She is best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series, which has won multiple awards and sold more than 500 million copies, becoming the best-selling book series in history. The books are the basis of a popular film series, over which Rowling had overall approval on the scripts and was a producer on the final films. Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. There were six sequels, of which the last, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released in 2007. Since then, Rowling has written several books for adult readers, including The Casual Vacancy (2012) and the Cormoran Strike series, written under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. Rowling has supported multiple charities, including Comic Relief, One Parent Families, and Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain, as well as launching her own charity, Lumos. Rowling has also been a prominent critic of various aspects of government policy, particularly the UK's treatment of refugees and asylum seekers, and of the Trump administration in the United States. Rowling has received honorary degrees from St Andrews University, the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh Napier University, the University of Exeter, the University of Aberdeen, and Harvard University, for whom she spoke at the commencement ceremony in 2008. She has also been awarded numerous literary awards, including the British Book Awards' Children's Book of the Year, and the Hugo Award. In 2012, Rowling was assessed as the 13th most powerful woman in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4. Forbes listed Rowling as the 88th most powerful woman in the world in 2016.",

Her first novel, The Bluest Eye, was published in 1970. The critically acclaimed Song of Solomon (1977) brought her national attention and won the National Book Critics Circle Award. In 1988, Morrison won the Pulitzer Prize for Beloved (1987); she gained worldwide recognition when she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993. Born and raised in Lorain, Ohio, Morrison graduated from Howard University in 1953 and went to graduate school at Cornell University. She later taught English at Howard University and also married and had two children before divorcing in 1964. In the late 1960s, she became the first black female editor in fiction at Random House in New York City. In the 1970s and 1980s, she developed her own reputation as an author, and her perhaps most famous work, Beloved, was made into a film in 1998. Morrison's writing is known for its poetic prose, vivid dialogue, and richly detailed characters. She explored themes of race, gender, and identity in her works, often focusing on the experiences of African Americans. Her novels often feature strong female characters who confront difficult situations and overcome adversity. Morrison's work has been praised for its powerful storytelling and its ability to capture the complexities of the human experience. In addition to her writing, Morrison was also a professor at Princeton University from 1989 to 2006. She was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and served on the board of the Authors Guild. In 2012, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama. Morrison's legacy as a writer and cultural icon continues to be celebrated today. Her works have been translated into numerous languages and are widely read around the world.

He is best known for his novels The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which has been called \"The Great American Novel\". Twain grew up in Hannibal, Missouri, which would later serve as the setting for these two novels. He apprenticed with a printer and also worked as a typesetter and contributed articles to his older brother Orion's newspaper. After toiling as a printer in various cities, he became a master riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River, before heading west to join Orion. He was a failure at gold mining, so he next turned to journalism. While a reporter, he wrote a humorous story, \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,\" which became very popular and brought nationwide attention. His travelogues were also well-received. Twain had found his calling. He achieved great success as a writer and public speaker. His wit and satire earned praise from critics and peers, and he was a friend to presidents, artists, industrialists, and European royalty. However, he lacked financial acumen. Though he made a great deal of money from his writings and lectures, he squandered it on various ventures, in particular the Paige Compositor, and was forced to declare bankruptcy. With the help of Henry Huttleston Rogers, however, he eventually overcame his financial troubles. Twain worked hard to ensure that all of his creditors were paid in full, even though his bankruptcy had relieved him of the legal responsibility. Born during a visit by Halley's Comet, he died on its return. He was lauded as the \"greatest American humorist of his age\", and William Faulkner called Twain \"the father of American literature\".",

He was born on March 6, 1927, in Aracataca, Colombia, and died on April 17, 2014, in Mexico City, Mexico. He is considered one of the most significant writers of the 20th century and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982. Garcia Marquez was raised by his maternal grandparents in Aracataca, a small town in northern Colombia. His grandfather was a retired colonel who had fought in the Thousand Days War, a civil war that took place in Colombia from 1899 to 1902. Garcia Marquez's grandmother was a storyteller who would often tell him magical tales that would later influence his writing. Garcia Marquez began his career as a journalist in the 1940s, working for various newspapers and magazines in Colombia and Europe. In 1955, he published his first novel, \"Leaf Storm,\" which was well-received by critics but did not gain widespread popularity. It was not until the publication of his masterpiece, \"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\" in 1967 that Garcia Marquez became a household name. The novel tells the story of the Buendia family over seven generations in the fictional town of Macondo, and is considered a masterpiece of magical realism. Garcia Marquez's other notable works include \"Love in the Time of Cholera,\" \"Chronicle of a Death Foretold,\" and \"The General in His Labyrinth.\" His writing often explored themes of love, death, and the human condition, and was known for its magical realism, a literary style that blends the fantastical with the real. In addition to his writing, Garcia Marquez was also a political activist and was involved in leftist politics throughout his life. He was a close friend of Cuban leader Fidel Castro and was a vocal critic of US foreign policy in Latin America. Garcia Marquez's influence on literature and culture cannot be overstated. His works have been translated into dozens of languages and have sold millions of copies worldwide. He is considered one of the most important writers of the 20th century and his legacy continues to inspire writers and readers around the world.",

            "passage": "Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald (September 24, 1896 – December 21, 1940) was an American novelist, essayist, screenwriter, and short-story writer. He was best known for his novels depicting the flamboyance and excess of the Jazz Age—a term which he popularized. During his lifetime, Fitzgerald completed four novels (including The Great Gatsby), one play, and more than 150 short stories. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century. Born in St. Paul, Minnesota, Fitzgerald attended Princeton University, where he began writing what would become his first novel, This Side of Paradise. The novel was published in 1920 and became an instant success, making Fitzgerald a celebrity at the age of 24. He married Zelda Sayre, a Southern belle, in 1920, and the couple became the embodiment of the Jazz Age, with their extravagant lifestyle and partying. Fitzgerald's second novel, The Beautiful and Damned, was published in 1922 and was followed by his most famous work, The Great Gatsby, in 1925. The novel, which explores the decadence and excess of the wealthy elite in the 1920s, is now considered a classic of American literature. However, it was not a commercial success during Fitzgerald's lifetime. Fitzgerald's later years were marked by financial difficulties, alcoholism, and declining health. He moved to Hollywood in 1937 to work as a screenwriter, but his career was hampered by his drinking and his reputation as a difficult writer to work with. He died of a heart attack in 1940 at the age of 44. Fitzgerald's work has had a lasting impact on American literature and popular culture. His writing captures the spirit of the Jazz Age and the disillusionment of the post-World War I era. His characters are often flawed and complex, struggling to find meaning in a world that seems to have lost its way. Fitzgerald's legacy continues to inspire writers and readers alike, and his work remains a vital part of the American literary canon.",

His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.",

Founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge—from the classics to the sciences, and from the theoretical to the applied. These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell's founding principle, a popular 1868 Ezra Cornell quotation: \"I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.\" The university is broadly organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus, with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy. The university also administers two satellite medical campuses, one in New York City and one in Education City, Qatar. Cornell is one of three private land grant universities in the nation and the only one in New York. Of its seven undergraduate colleges, three are state-supported statutory or contract colleges through the State University of New York (SUNY) system, including its agricultural and veterinary colleges. As a land grant college, it operates a cooperative extension outreach program in every county of New York and receives annual funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions. The Cornell University Ithaca Campus comprises 745 acres, but is much larger when the Cornell Botanic Gardens (more than 4,300 acres) and the numerous university-owned lands in New York City are considered. Since its founding, Cornell has been a co-educational, non-sectarian institution where admission has been offered irrespective of religion or race. Cornell counts more than 245,000 living alumni, 34 Marshall Scholars, 31 Rhodes Scholars and 44 Nobel laureates affiliated with the university as faculty or students. The student body consists of more than 14,000 undergraduate and 8,000 graduate students from all 50 American states and 119 countries. Cornell University was founded on April 27, 1865; the New York State (NYS) Senate authorized the university as the state's land grant institution. Senator Ezra Cornell offered his farm in Ithaca, New York, as a site and $500,000 of his personal fortune as an initial endowment. Fellow senator and educator Andrew Dickson White agreed to be the first president. During the next three years, White oversaw the construction of the first two buildings and traveled to attract students and faculty.",

Commonly named among the Great American Novels, the work is among the first in major American literature to be written throughout in vernacular English, characterized by local color regionalism. It is told in the first person by Huckleberry \"Huck\" Finn, the narrator of two other Twain novels (Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective) and a friend of Tom Sawyer. It is a direct sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. The book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River. Set in a Southern antebellum society that had ceased to exist over 20 years before the work was published, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an often scathing satire on entrenched attitudes, particularly racism. Perennially popular with readers, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has also been the continued object of study by literary critics since its publication. The book was widely criticized upon release because of its extensive use of coarse language. Throughout the 20th century, and despite arguments that the protagonist and the tenor of the book are anti-racist, criticism of the book continued due to both its perceived use of racial stereotypes and its frequent use of the racial slur \"nigger\".",

It was designed to automate the process of typesetting, which at the time was a laborious and time-consuming task. The machine used a complex system of gears and levers to arrange individual letters and characters into lines of type, which could then be used to print books, newspapers, and other printed materials. Despite its promise, the Paige Compositor was plagued by technical problems and never achieved widespread adoption. The machine was expensive to produce and maintain, and its complex design made it prone to breakdowns and malfunctions. In addition, the machine was difficult to operate, requiring skilled operators who were in short supply. Despite these challenges, the Paige Compositor remains an important milestone in the history of typesetting and printing. Its design influenced later machines, such as the Linotype and Monotype machines, which became the standard for typesetting in the early 20th century. Today, the Paige Compositor is remembered as a pioneering effort to automate the process of typesetting, and as a reminder of the challenges and opportunities that come with technological innovation.",
