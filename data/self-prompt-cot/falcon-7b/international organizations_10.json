As GATT continued to operate, it was eventually replaced by the Uruguay Round, a GATT-based process which ended with the final agreements of Marrakech in 1994. In the 1990s, in addition to a series of bilateral trade agreements, a series of new rules and laws were added, as well as the establishment of a Multilateral Trading System that included the creation of a new trade organization called the WTO.

Its main purpose is to gather information from police forces around the world and to help coordinate investigations into international crimes in an efficient and coordinated manner. Its role includes collecting data from over 200 countries. Interpol has an effective system of 186 member countries which it is obliged to comply with by its governing body. There are currently 40 associate members (that pay a similar levy) including China. In March 2017, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution for the Secretary General to submit to the 174 member states of Interpol, the recommendation that Interpol should be transformed from an existing national police force into a new international organization. Currently Interpol has been working on the creation of a new international police organization which would allow more member countries to join Interpol and share more information. ICPO was founded in 1950 and became effective in 1958 when it took over from Interpol as it was no longer meeting international standards. It was then established on 1 May 1958.

The organization is often used as an intermediary in times of conflict or disaster between governmental and other relief organizations. The first three years of the organization were marked by a significant lack of funding and personnel, but this improved greatly during the latter years of the First World War. This was the first time in modern history that a Red Cross organization provided emergency services to the victims of a war zone. A few years later, after a second major war in Europe, the ICRC was granted the status of a Red Cross society. In 1914, its charter was ratified by the International Conference on Humanitarian Aid, or the Geneva Conference.

In general, the more complex the agreement, the more likely it is to be disregarded, or only partially followed. In the future, more specific WTO agreements will probably be sought.

Lauber's research has influenced the work of many modern fluid dynamicists and he is considered a pioneer of the subject.\" \"In 1956, Lauber proposed the 'Lauber Number', which is a mathematical equation for the amount of boundary-layer thickness required in a fluid for a given flow speed and wall angle.",
